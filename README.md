# COBHouseLights

COB LEDs are a modern way of providing domestic lighting at low cost and high efficency. Ten 2W 12V COB LED panels can be bought from AliExpress for about £4 (each LED panel has 18 LEDs). A 2W COB panel is roughly equivalent to a 20W incandescent bulb.

The solution presented here uses a 12V 5A mains supply which will power about 30 COB panels. This is about the same amount of light as provided by 600W of incandescent lighting!
The lights are dimmable and can be controlled over the home network.
The total cost of all the components should be in the order of about £30.
